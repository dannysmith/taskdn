# Claude Instructions for tdn-cli

See the parent `../CLAUDE.md` for general project instructions.

High-level documentation (requirements, technical overview) lives in `../docs/product-overviews/cli/`.

## Overview

This is the CLI tool for Taskdn - a hybrid TypeScript + Rust project:
- **TypeScript layer** (Bun): CLI interface, prompts, output formatting
- **Rust core** (NAPI-RS): Performance-critical operations (parsing, search)

## Key Commands

```bash
bun run check        # Run all checks (TS + Rust)
bun run fix          # Run all formatters (Prettier + cargo fmt)
bun run build        # Build release NAPI bindings
bun run build:dev    # Build debug NAPI bindings
```

## Project-Specific Notes

- The `bindings/` directory is auto-generated by NAPI-RS - never edit manually
- Use `bun` (not pnpm/npm) for all JS/TS operations
- Rust code lives in `crates/core/` and exposes functions via `#[napi]` macro
- TypeScript types for Rust functions are auto-generated in `bindings/index.d.ts`
