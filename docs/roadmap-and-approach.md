# Roadmap and Approach

## General Development Principles

### Minimal by Default

We start with the simplest possible implementation and only add complexity when it provides clear value. This applies to both the file format (few required fields, sensible defaults) and the user interfaces (no bells and whistles unless they're actually necessary). Features earn their place by solving real problems, not by looking impressive.
