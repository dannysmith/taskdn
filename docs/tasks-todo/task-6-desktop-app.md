Cross-platform Tauri desktop application.

## Scope

- Things-like UI/UX for day-to-day task management
- Quick capture (global hotkey)
- Views: Inbox, Today, Upcoming, Projects, Areas
- Drag-and-drop organization

## Notes

Depends on Phase 3 (TypeScript SDK). Tauri for native performance with web technologies. This is the flagship interface.
