# Phase 6: Desktop App

Cross-platform Tauri desktop application.

## Scope

- Things-like UI/UX for day-to-day task management
- Cross-platform Tauri app which uses the Rust SDK
- URL Scheme support
- Global Keyboard shortcut for creating a new task. Uses Apple Intelligence where supported to enrich/correct tasks ([a la Handy](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/pull/391/files))
- Native notifications and reminders

## Notes

Depends on Phase 3 (TypeScript SDK). Tauri for native performance with web technologies. This is the flagship interface.

- I could use some of Astro Editor's codebase (YAML, Editor etc) to help with reading and writing files here?
