# Phase 1: Setup, Specification, Research & Planning

Foundation work for the Taskdn project.

## Scope

- [x] Set up monorepo boilerplate
- [x] Write up philosophy and specification
- [x] Finalize the task/project/area specification in `docs/user-guide/`
- [x] Clean up and improve README, CLAUDE.md and `docs/user-guide/`
- [x] Research key dependencies and architectural decisions
- [x] Create architecture guide for Rust SDK
- [x] Set up `taskdn-rust` directory with boilerplate, AI tooling, task system etc.
- [x] Set up demo-vault for testing

## Notes

This phase must be completed before any SDK work begins, as the specification drives all implementations.
