# Task: Potential Rust API Refactorings Findings

> Review for potential Rust refactoring in preparation for possibly extracting the Rust code into a package which can be used in the Tauri app, and eventually published for other users. Maybe including the NAPI TS Bindings so we get a TS API for free with this work. This doesn't need to actually have this ready to do this. It's more about preparatory work we could do uh low hanging fruit which would make this easier to do in the future.

Currently the Rust code here is part of the TypeScript CLI. As in it's part of the CLI package and uses NAPI bindings. It may be that we want to keep it this way. However, at some point soon we will be building a Tauri-based desktop app, Which will need many of the same uh features on the Rust side in order to read files from disk, deal with file watching, build indexes, and so on. So I would like to look at the possibilities here when it comes to either A) extracting a TS library (with underlying Rust/NAPI) which can be used by the Tauri app, or **much more likeley**: extracting a Rust library from the CLI project which could be shared by both the Tauri desktop app and the CLI. It may be that this is not at all worth doing. Once we explore the possibility, the advantages and disadvantages of this at a high level, We should look at the existing Rust "external" api in the CLI project And see if there is any easy stuff we could do that would make extracting it much easier and more sensible down the line. But it may not be worth doing any of this. It may be better simply to duplicate some of the code we have here over into the Tauri app. Note that eventually I like the idea of having a public Rust/TS SDK so people can build apps which work with the files. But that's probably a long way away.
