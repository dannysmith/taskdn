# Task: Potential Rust API Refactorings Findings

> Review for potential Rust refactoring in preparation for possibly extracting the Rust code into a package which can be used in the Tauri app, and eventually published for other users. Maybe including the NAPI TS Bindings so we get a TS API for free with this work. This doesn't need to actually have this ready to do this. It's more about preparatory work we could do uh low hanging fruit which would make this easier to do in the future.
