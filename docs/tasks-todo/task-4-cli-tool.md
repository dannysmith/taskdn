# Phase 4: CLI Tool

Command-line interface for humans and AI agents.

## Scope

- Human-friendly formatted output (colors, tables, interactive prompts)
- Machine-readable output (JSON) for AI agents
- Commands: list, add, complete, edit, search, etc.
- Configuration for task directory locations
- Shell completions

## Notes

Depends on Phase 3 (TypeScript SDK). Should optimize for both human usability and AI agent consumption.
