# Phase 5: Claude Code Skill

Claude Code skill and commands for AI-native task management.

## Scope

- SKILL.md with context about the task system
- Custom slash commands for common operations
- Integration guidance for Claude Code sessions
- Optimized prompts for task creation/management

## Notes

Can potentially be developed in parallel with or before the CLI, as it may use file operations directly or wrap the CLI.
