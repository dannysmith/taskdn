# Task: Specs

## Phase 1. Review Beans external CLI interface

Review https://github.com/hmans/beans for useful **external** patterns to follow. Produce document.

## Phase 2. Split Spec Docs into 3, informed by doc from phase 1 and previous CLI spec work.

We need to split the original single spec dock `/tdn-specs/S1-core.md` into three docs as per `/tdn-specs/README.md` And at the same time incorporate the findings from phase 1 and all the work we did on defining the CLI spec (`/docs/product-overviews/cli/cli-requirements.md). The idea here is to end up with S1 describing only the fundamental rules for the files on disk, um which is ninety percent of what's in that already. and then incorporate much of the guidance about how interfaces should think about this stuff into S2. Or we can probably leave S3 fairly empty at the moment. I think even in the end that's only gonna have a few notes in it about how to safely read and write files, um maybe some decisions on front matter formatting and so on and so forth.

## Phase 3. Cleanup

Check all of the spec docks and the readme to ensure that they are are are are are are are are are are are well formatted and and not in any way contradictory. See if there's anything we can do to simplify how they are written without stopping them being informal. And also ensure that S2 is sufficiently generalized. We should also ensure that uh any references to those in any other documentation has been updated.
