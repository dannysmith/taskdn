# Task: Clean up project etc

This is a simple task just to tidy up all of the documentation uh in this project. I've done much of this already myself. But we should review:

- [ ] docs/product-overviews/ - Apart from the CLI, most of these are probably gonna be stubs at the moment, because we haven't made decisions on them. Um we should split out any technical implementation details around how we're gonna build into the tech document here while leaving most of the other stuff to do with the interface and and how it the requirements from the outside in the requirements document.
- [ ] docs/overview - We should be able to leave most of this as it is, but we might just want to slightly flesh out some of the stuff at the bottom and generally do a spell check and all the rest of it. Or we may want to consider including some important stuff from the specs here. Uh but in slightly less formal language in a cut down form.
- [ ] docs/README.md - Check that this is accurate.
- [ ] docs/roadmap-and-approach.md - Uh make sure that we've updated this with a high level, very quick roadmap at the end, uh as well as any other important principles.
- [ ] CLAUDE.md & REAME.md - And just check that this is still accurate.
