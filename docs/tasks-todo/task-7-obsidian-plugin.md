# Phase 7: Obsidian Plugin

Lightweight Obsidian plugin for task integration.

## Scope

- Render WikiLinks to task files as checkable items
- Click to toggle task status
- Command to create new task from selection
- Command to convert checklist item to task file
- Minimal footprint - not a full task manager

## Notes

Should complement, not replace, the desktop app. Focus on seamless integration with note-taking workflow.
