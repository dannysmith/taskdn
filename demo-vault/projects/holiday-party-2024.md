Threw the annual holiday party on December 14th. Great success - about 25 people came, food was excellent, and the mulled wine was a hit.

## What Worked
- Catering from [[Lucia's Italian]] was perfect
- Starting at 7pm gave people time to arrive after weekend errands
- The playlist was solid - see [[Holiday Party 2024 Playlist]]

## For Next Year
- Order more wine - [[Chris]] drank most of it
- Get someone else to handle coats - got chaotic
- Maybe do a white elephant gift exchange - [[Emma]] suggested this
