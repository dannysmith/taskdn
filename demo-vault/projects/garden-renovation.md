## Overview

The back garden is currently a mess. Want to turn it into a nice outdoor space for relaxing, hosting, and maybe growing some vegetables.

## Why Blocked

Need to focus on the home office first. Also, better to start garden work in spring when the weather is suitable.

## Ideas

- Clear out existing overgrowth
- Simple patio area
- Raised beds for vegetables
- Some seating
- Outdoor lighting

## To Research

- Local landscapers for quotes
- DIY vs professional for the patio
- What vegetables grow well in this climate
