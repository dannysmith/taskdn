Building a CLI tool to scratch my own itch, then open sourcing it.

## The Idea

A simple tool for managing dotfiles and development environment setup across machines.

## Why

- I keep solving this problem manually
- Existing tools are either too simple or too complex
- Good opportunity to practice Rust

## MVP Features

- Symlink management for dotfiles
- Simple config file format
- Cross-platform (macOS, Linux)
