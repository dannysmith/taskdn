description: Open source TypeScript library for parsing task-oriented markdown files.
---

## Concept

A small, focused library for parsing markdown files with YAML frontmatter, specifically designed for task management use cases.

## Planned Features

- Parse YAML frontmatter
- Extract task metadata
- Support WikiLinks
- TypeScript-first with good types
- Zero runtime dependencies

## Prior Art

- gray-matter (frontmatter parsing)
- remark (markdown parsing)
- But nothing specifically for task files

## Status

Still in ideation. Need to validate that this is useful enough to open source.
