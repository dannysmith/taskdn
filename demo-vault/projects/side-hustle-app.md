## The Idea

A simple app for people with side hustles to track:
- Income from various sources
- Related expenses
- Simple profit/loss view
- Tax-relevant summaries

## Why No Area?

This is a speculative project that doesn't fit neatly into current life areas. It's a potential product idea that might become a business, a learning project, or might get dropped.

## Validation Needed

- [ ] Survey potential users
- [ ] Competitive analysis
- [ ] Technical feasibility for solo developer

## MVP Features

1. Add income entries (amount, source, date)
2. Add expense entries (amount, category, date)
3. Dashboard with running totals
4. Export for tax purposes

## Tech Considerations

- React Native for cross-platform
- Local-first with optional sync
- Simple, no-account-required start
