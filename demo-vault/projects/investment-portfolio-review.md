**NOTE: This project was dropped.** Decided to keep current allocation and revisit in Q2 instead.

## Original Goal

Review current investment allocation and rebalance based on:
- Current life stage and risk tolerance
- Market conditions
- Tax-loss harvesting opportunities

## Why Dropped

After initial research, realized the current allocation is fine. The effort to rebalance wouldn't provide meaningful benefit. Better to focus energy elsewhere and revisit when there's a material change in circumstances.

## Future Consideration

Revisit this in Q2 or if:
- Major life change
- Significant market shift
- Tax situation changes
