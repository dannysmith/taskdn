## Approach

Combination of reading, exercises, and building things.

## Resources

1. **The Rust Book** - Official guide, work through completely
2. **Rustlings** - Small exercises to practice syntax
3. **Exercism Rust Track** - More substantial exercises
4. **Build something real** - Apply learning to actual projects

## Progress

### Completed

### Up Next
- [ ] Chapters 5-8 (structs, enums, collections)
- [ ] First small CLI project

## Notes

Ownership and borrowing are the key concepts. Spend extra time here until they click.

[[CJ]] has been helpful with questions. His [[Handy]] project is a good reference for real-world Rust.
