This is about **maintaining my coding practice** and staying current with the latest technology trends.

My goal is to remain technically sharp while also exploring new technologies and approaches that interest me.

I'm doing good in this area if...

- I'm writing code on some project every week.
- I'm actively maintaining interesting projects.
- I'm contributing to open source when I can.
- I'm continuously learning new technologies and approaches.
- My GitHub profile reflects consistent activity.

## Current Tech Interests

- Rust and systems programming
- AI/ML tooling and agents
- Modern web development (React, TypeScript)
- CLI tools and developer experience

## Resources

- [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/)

## Current Projects
