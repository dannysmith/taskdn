This is about **finding a partner** and building a meaningful relationship.

I'm doing good in this area if...

- I'm actively putting myself out there and meeting new people.
- I'm being authentic and true to myself.
- I'm learning from each experience.
- I'm not settling but also not being unrealistic.
- I'm enjoying the process rather than just focusing on outcomes.

## Approach

Focus on meeting people through activities I genuinely enjoy. Dating apps are a tool, not the only strategy.

## Reminders

- Quality over quantity
- Be patient with the process
- Stay open to unexpected connections
