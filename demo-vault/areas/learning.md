This area is about **continuous learning and personal development**.

I'm doing good in this area if...

- I'm actively learning new skills and concepts.
- I'm reading regularly (books, articles, papers).
- I'm staying curious and asking questions.
- I'm applying what I learn in practical ways.
- I'm sharing knowledge with others.

## Current Learning Interests

- Systems thinking and mental models
- Writing and communication
- Technical topics (see [[Coding]])
- Business and strategy

## Learning Approaches

1. **Books** - Deep dives into topics
2. **Courses** - Structured learning when needed
3. **Projects** - Learning by doing
4. **Teaching** - Solidify understanding by explaining

## Reading List

Maintain a reading list and actually work through it. Mix of technical, business, and general interest.

See [[Reading List]] for the current queue.

## Recently Finished

- [[Atomic Habits]] - good but could have been shorter
