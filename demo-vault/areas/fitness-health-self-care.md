This area is about **maintaining physical and mental health** so I can show up as my best self.

I'm doing good in this area if...

- I'm exercising regularly (at least 3x per week).
- I'm eating well and maintaining a healthy diet.
- I'm getting adequate sleep (7-8 hours most nights).
- I'm managing stress effectively.
- I'm taking breaks and not burning out.
- I'm keeping up with health appointments and check-ups.
