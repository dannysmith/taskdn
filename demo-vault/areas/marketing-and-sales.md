This is about **building visibility and generating opportunities** through marketing, networking, and sales activities.

I'm doing good in this area if...

- I'm consistently putting myself out there and building my personal brand.
- I'm generating leads and having sales conversations regularly.
- I'm building relationships that lead to opportunities.
- My marketing efforts are translating into tangible results.
- I'm staying top-of-mind with my network and audience.
