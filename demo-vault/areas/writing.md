This is about **publishing and building an audience** through writing.

> "If you ever needed another reason to learn in public... people will assume you're more competent than you are. This will get you invites to very cool exclusive events filled with high-achieving, interesting people."

I'm doing good in this area if...

- I'm regularly publishing content that showcases my thinking.
- I'm building an audience and growing my reach.
- I'm learning in public and sharing my journey.
- I'm creating valuable content that helps others.
- My writing is opening doors to new opportunities.

## Content Types

### Blog Posts
Long-form technical and thought pieces. These take time but have lasting value.

### Newsletter
Regular updates for subscribers. More personal, less polished.

### Social Posts
Quick thoughts, links, and engagement. Low effort, high visibility.

## Writing Process

1. Capture ideas when they come
2. Let ideas marinate
3. Draft quickly, edit slowly
4. Publish imperfect work rather than perfect drafts

## Topics I Write About

- Technology and software development
- Productivity and workflows

- Learning and self-improvement
