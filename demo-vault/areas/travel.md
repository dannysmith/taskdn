description: Exploring new places and creating experiences.

This is about **seeing new things and creating meaningful experiences** through travel.

I have the freedom and flexibility to travel, and I should make the most of it. Travel broadens perspective, creates memories, and often leads to unexpected opportunities.

I'm doing good in this area if...

- I'm taking at least one significant trip per quarter.
- I'm exploring new places, not just returning to the same spots.
- I'm stepping out of my comfort zone when traveling.
- I'm creating meaningful memories and connections.
- I'm balancing spontaneity with enough planning to make trips happen.

## Travel Philosophy

- **Slow travel** - Stay longer in fewer places rather than rushing around
- **Local experiences** - Seek out what locals do, not just tourist attractions
- **Working remotely** - Take advantage of the ability to work from anywhere
- **Visit friends** - Use travel as an excuse to see people living in other places
