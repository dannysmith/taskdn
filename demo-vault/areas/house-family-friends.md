description: Home maintenance and nurturing important relationships.

This is about **maintaining my living space** and **nurturing relationships** with family and friends.

I'm doing good in this area if...

- My home is clean, organized, and a place I enjoy being.
- I'm regularly connecting with family members.
- I'm maintaining and deepening friendships.
- I'm being a good friend/family member when people need me.
- I'm hosting people and creating shared experiences.

## Home

Keep the space functional and pleasant. Don't let things pile up or break without fixing them.

### Regular Maintenance
- Weekly cleaning
- Seasonal deep cleans
- Fix things when they break (don't let the list grow)

## Relationships

### Family
Regular calls with [[Mum]] and [[Dad]]. Make time for visits. [[Sister|Laura]] is in Manchester - visit more often.

### Friends
Proactive reach-outs. Don't wait for others to initiate. Quality time matters more than frequency.

Key people: [[Jake]], [[Emma]], [[Chris]], [[Sophie]], [[Tom]]

## Hosting

Try to have people over regularly. Doesn't need to be fancy - simple dinners, game nights, or just coffee.

See [[Holiday Party 2024]] for lessons learned from last big event.
