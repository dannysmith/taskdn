This area is about building **financial security and freedom**.

I'm doing good in this area if...

- I have a clear picture of my financial situation at all times.
- I'm living below my means with a small surplus each month.
- I have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses.
- I'm on top of all tax obligations with money set aside.
- I'm making progress toward long-term financial goals.
- I'm not stressed about money.

## Key Principles

1. **Track everything** - You can't manage what you don't measure
2. **Pay yourself first** - Savings before spending
3. **Avoid bad debt** - Credit cards paid in full monthly
4. **Invest consistently** - Time in market beats timing the market
