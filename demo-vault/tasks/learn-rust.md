Keep meaning to do this. Started the Rust book twice but never finished.

## Resources

- The Rust Programming Language (book)
- Rustlings exercises
- Zero to Production in Rust

## Why

- Better systems programming knowledge
- Could be useful for performance-critical tools
- Just curious

Iceboxed: Not a priority right now. Will revisit when I have a specific project that needs it.
