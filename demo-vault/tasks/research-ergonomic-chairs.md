Finding the right chair is crucial. Spending significant time sitting, so worth investing in quality.

## Research so far

### Herman Miller Aeron
- Pros: Great reputation, 12-year warranty
- Cons: Expensive ($1400+), might be overhyped

### Steelcase Leap
- Pros: Very adjustable, good for tall people
- Cons: Also expensive, harder to find used

### Secretlab Titan
- Pros: Good value, lots of features
- Cons: Gaming aesthetic, mixed long-term reviews

### Branch Ergonomic Chair
- Pros: Good price point (~$450), looks professional
- Cons: Newer company, less track record

## Next steps

- [ ] Check if any local stores have these to try
- [ ] Look for used Aeron/Steelcase options on [[Facebook Marketplace]]
- [ ] Read more long-term reviews
- [ ] Ask [[Mike]] about his Aeron - he's had it for 5 years
