This is the important chapter about ownership and borrowing. Take time to really understand it.

## Sections

- [ ] 4.1 What is Ownership?
- [ ] 4.2 References and Borrowing
- [ ] 4.3 The Slice Type

## Notes

Take notes and do the examples. This is foundational to everything else in Rust.

See [[Rust Ownership Notes]] for my notes so far. [[CJ]] said this chapter clicked for him after the third read-through.
