## Topic

"5 TypeScript Patterns I Use in Every Project"

## Outline

1. Branded types for type-safe IDs
2. Discriminated unions for state machines
3. `satisfies` operator for type inference
4. Const assertions for literal types
5. Template literal types for string validation

## Status

Draft is about 60% complete. Need to add code examples for patterns 4 and 5.

Target: Publish as first post on relaunched blog.
