## Original Idea

Build a custom headless CMS specifically for my blog workflow.

## Why Dropped

Classic over-engineering. Spent 2 weeks on this before realizing:

1. MDX files in a git repo work fine
2. Astro's content collections do everything I need
3. I was procrastinating on actually writing content

Lesson learned: Use existing tools. Focus on writing, not building tools to write.
