Initial Astro project setup for the website rebuild.

## Progress

- [x] Created new Astro project with `npm create astro@latest`
- [x] Added Tailwind CSS integration
- [x] Basic TypeScript config
- [ ] Set up component structure
- [ ] Create base layout
- [ ] Add Vercel adapter

Running into an issue with the Tailwind preflight conflicting with some base styles. Need to figure out the right configuration.
