# Claude Instructions for taskdn-rust

See @docs/ for full documentation.
See @docs/tasks.md for instructions on task management.
See `../docs/user-guide/1-philosophy.md` and `../docs/user-guide/2-the-specification.md` for details of the overall specification and project (will be outside project root if we're working in `taskdn-rust/`).

## Project Overview

Rust library for parsing, querying, and manipulating Taskdn task files.

## Core Rules

### New Sessions

- Read @docs/tasks.md for task management
- Review `docs/developer/architecture-guide.md` for essential patterns
- Consult specialized guides when working on specific features
- Check git status and project structure

### Development Practices

**CRITICAL:** Follow these strictly:

1. **Read Before Editing**: Always read files first to understand context
2. **Follow Established Patterns**: Use patterns from this file and `docs/developer`
3. **Senior Architect Mindset**: Consider performance, maintainability, testability
